    "\n",
    "**Before jumping right into Time Series Ananlysis , lets first understand what is Time Series Data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time-series data is a collection of data points over a set period. Plot the points on a graph, and one of your axes would always be time.\n",
    "* What sets time series data apart from other data is that the analysis can show how variables change over time. \n",
    "* The frequency of recorded data points may be hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly or annually.\n",
    "* In other words, time is a crucial variable because it shows how the data adjusts over the course of the data points as well as the final results. \n",
    " It provides an additional source of information and a set order of dependencies between the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The time series data may be of three types:-\n",
    "1.  **Time series data** - The observations of the values of a variable recorded at different points in time is called time series data.\n",
    "1.  **Cross sectional data** - It is the data of one or more variables recorded at the same point in time. Ex:-gross annual income for each of 1000 randomly chosen households in New York City for the year 2000.\n",
    "1.  **Pooled data**- It is the combination of time series data and cross sectional data.\n",

    "**Now that we have understood what Time Series data means .. lets understand what is Time Series analysis?**\n",
    "* Time-series analysis is a method of analyzing data to extract useful statistical information and characteristics. \n",
    "* A time series analysis encompasses statistical methods for analyzing time series data. These methods enable us to extract meaningful statistics, patterns and other characteristics of the data. \n",
    "* Time series are visualized with the help of line charts. So, time series analysis involves understanding inherent aspects of the time series data so that we can create meaningful and accurate forecasts.\n",
    "* One of the study's main goals is to predict future value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of time series analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Electrical activity in the brain\n",
    "    Rainfall measurements\n",

    "    Monthly subscribers\n",
    "    Heartbeats per minute\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Why organizations use time series data analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time series analysis helps organizations understand the underlying causes of trends or systemic patterns over time. \n",
    "* Using data visualizations, business users can see seasonal trends and dig deeper into why these trends occur.\n",
    "* When organizations analyze data over consistent intervals, they can also use time series forecasting to predict the likelihood of future events.  "

    "# Components of a Time-Series\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trend** - The trend shows a general direction of the time series data over a long period of time. A trend can be increasing(upward), decreasing(downward), or horizontal(stationary).\n",
    "1. **Seasonality** - The seasonality component exhibits a trend that repeats with respect to timing, direction, and magnitude. Some examples include an increase in water consumption in summer due to hot weather conditions.\n",
    "1. **Noise** - Outliers or missing values\n",
    "1. **Cyclical Component** - These are the trends with no set repetition over a particular period of time. A cycle refers to the period of ups and downs, booms and slums of a time series, mostly observed in business cycles. These cycles do not exhibit a seasonal variation but generally occur over a time period of 3 to 12 years depending on the nature of the time series.\n",
    "1. **Irregular Variation** - These are the fluctuations in the time series data which become evident when trend and cyclical variations are removed. These variations are unpredictable, erratic, and may or may not be random.\n",
    "1. **ETS Decomposition** - ETS Decomposition is used to separate different components of a time series. The term ETS stands for Error, Trend and Seasonality.\n",

And work on it and your hyper parameters, until you get the desired performance, measured using the validation set. Often, once you've done that, you can retrain using both the training and validation data.And then test on the test(or forecast) period to see if your model will perform just as well.\n",

    "    And if it does, then you could take the unusual step of retraining again, using also the test data. But why would you do that? Well, it's because the test data is the closest data you have to the current point in time. And as such it's often the strongest signal in determining future values. If your model is not trained using that data, too, then it may not be optimal.\n",
